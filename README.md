- Development environment configuration
- CI/CD pipeline setup
- Infrastructure management
- Security implementation
- Best practices and guidelines

## System Architecture

### Components Overview
Our CI/CD workflow integrates the following key components:

#### Development Environment
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code
- **Configuration Files**:
  - settings.xml
  - buildspec.yml
  - appspec.yml
- **Local Scripts**: Custom automation scripts

#### AWS Services Integration
1. **CodeArtifact**
   - Package management
   - Dependency resolution

2. **CodeBuild**
   - Source compilation
   - Testing execution
   - Artifact generation

3. **S3 Storage**
   - Build artifact storage
   - Version management
   - Deployment packages

4. **CodeDeploy**
   - Automated deployment
   - Environment management
   - Health monitoring

## Development Environment
